Download Windows version:
https://download-pa-s3.thethinkacademy.com/static-pa/package/win-pc-student/ThinkAcademy-2.19.1-win-2610.exe
Replace the exe with:
[2.10.3] ThinkAcademy-2.10.3-win-1409.exe
[2.14.0] ThinkAcademy-2.14.0-win-1813.exe
Note that it's pretty difficult to get the version because there is a 4 digit identifier at the end. (Build number?)

I am suspicious this app is also a keylogger, because any Ctrl+Shift+I shortcuts get sent to it.
This could mean that it captures your keystrokes even when not focused. (Version 2.14.0)

iOS and Android apps are a bit better, but they appear to use the same backend.
