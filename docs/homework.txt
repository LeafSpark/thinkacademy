The whole app is just a glorified web browser. It's pretty much just Electron and hosts an web interface at localhost:10010 which is 
accessible without any authentication.

The homework questions also are just (a web browser) to 
https://student-homework.thethinkacademy.com/exam? with these arguments:
pageType=answer
token=REDACTED (also absurdly long)
reportFromOrigin=2 (?)
schoolCode=415 (Area code?) [Fremont/USA=415]
platform=2 (Linux, mobile, Windows, macOS etc) [Windows=2]
homeworkId=REDACTED (32 char long hash)
planId=xxxxxx (6 character long ID maybe lesson number/homework number)
studentId=xxxxxxx (7 character long numerical ID)
classId=xxxxx (Fall, Spring, Pre-Algebra)
homeworkType=0 (Probably for like exams/tests)

Data sent every time an answer is submitted (console):
